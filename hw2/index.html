        <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
        <p>Musical Flight is an audio visualizer where birds follow the sound of music.</p>

        <!-- Embedded video with controls, autoplay, and loop -->
        <div style="text-align: center;">
            <video controls autoplay loop muted>
                <source src="Musical Flight.mp4" type="video/mp4">

        <!-- Image grid with 2 columns and 2 rows -->
        <div class="image-grid">

        <p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>
        <p>How to run:</p>
        <p>```</p>
        <pre><code class="language-bash">
        $ chuck hw2_main.ck
        </code></pre>
        <p>```</p>
        <p>Built on MacOS M1</p>

        <p><strong>Reflection</strong></p>
        <p>The goal of this visualizer was to have each bird that landed on the wire represent a musical voice. Given more time, I would have liked there to be more birds landing and taking off from the wire at various intervals, with "voices" coming and going more frequently. Additionally, I hardcoded the music and I wish that there were more random elements to it, such as birds flying by adding in little melodic lines that are generated.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>This project took so much longer than I anticipated... As I stated in the previous week's reading response, I spent too much time trying to add little flourishes in the beginning when I needed to just get the proof-of-concept down for the full narrative.</p>
        <p>Regarding difficulties... there were a&nbsp;<em>TON</em>. My envelope follower worked up until yesterday, no idea why it stopped working. It's pretty much just the code Kunwoo provided us; I tried debugging it for a solid 30 minutes trying all sorts of fixes (even setting it back to its initial state from the milestone, where <em>it worked</em>) and it just wouldn't give me a non-null result. A weird issue I just encountered hours before the due date is that the program only runs smoothly when it is played from my second external monitor: if it's played from my Mac laptop display or my primary external monitor display I experience terrible performance issues. No idea why that is, and I'm not going to question it as long as some form of it<em> works</em>.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Overall I am happy with the results even if I only implemented about 40% of what I wanted to do.</p>
